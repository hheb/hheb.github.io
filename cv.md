I have been a doctoral researcher at the University of Cologne since October 2020. Previously, I worked in development cooperation as an expert for impact evaluation and feminist research methods. In 2019, I received the DAAD's Carlo-Schmid-Fellowship and worked for UNAIDS Ethiopia. I have a B.Sc. in social sciences and an M.A. in political science, both from the University of Cologne. During my bachelor and master studies, I spent semesters abroad at the University of Cape Town and Sciences Po Paris. 

As I student, I was active in a number of student associations. Among them the KÃ¶lner Studierendenzeitung, where I was co-chief editor for some of the early issues. Later, I co-founded and was the first president of the Cologne Model United Nations society. I was also the Secretary-General and head of the organisation team when we hosted our first conference in 2018.
