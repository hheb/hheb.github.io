Hi there! 

I'm Helena. I'm a doctoral researcher at the University of Cologne. My research focuses on women and political leadership, gender and power dynamics in political institutions, and political representation and communication. I am also interesting in computational methods, such as applications for machine learning and natural language processing methods in the social sciences. My supervisor is Chitralekha Basu.

### Research

A non-exhaustive list of my ongoing research.

"Parties, portfolios, and power": This project examines the role of parties in the gendered dynamics of portfolio allocation in coalition governments. I am interested in the impact of women party leaders in the appointment of women to the most powerful cabinet positions.

"Using word embeddings to uncover gender bias in political speech": Building on recent literature that examines social biases in word embedding models, I develop an approach to quantify gender bias in political speech.

### Teaching

In the 2023 summer term, I am teaching research design and logic at the B.A. level. I am also happy to supervise bachelor and master theses in the fields of women in politics, democratic representation, political communication, and other adjecent fields. If you are interested in being supervised by me, do reach out to me via my <a href="mailto:heberer@wiso.uni-koeln.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">university email</a>.
