### Hi there! 

I'm Helena. I'm a doctoral researcher at the University of Cologne. My research focuses on women and political leadership, gender and power dynamics in political institutions, and political representation and communication. I am also interested in computational methods, such as applications for machine learning and natural language processing methods in the social sciences. My supervisor is Chitralekha Basu.

### Research

A non-exhaustive list of my ongoing research.

"Parties, portfolios, and power": This project examines the role of parties in the gendered dynamics of portfolio allocation in coalition governments. I am interested in the impact of women party leaders in the appointment of women to the most powerful cabinet positions.

"Using word embeddings to uncover gender bias in political speech": Building on recent literature that examines social biases in word embedding models, I develop an approach to quantify gender bias in political speech. 

"The Unequal Representation of Social Groups in Democracies", with Chitralekha Basu: We propose a new measure of group-specific ideological representation, which we term the 'relative opinion presence' of a social group, with several attractive properties. We employ this measure to compare the extent of unequal representation on three separate cleavages: gender, urban-rural location, and education. We find that, first, there are significant inequalities in ideological representation across all three cleavages we consider, but the largest inequalities occur based on education. Second, we find that the opinions of marginalized citizens are consistently and substantially better represented by in-group candidates. Third, we find that these inequalities are smaller under proportional representation. Our findings suggest that improvements in descriptive representation are likely to have a significant impact on the quality of substantive representation as well.

### Teaching

In the 2023 and 2024 summer terms, I teach research design and research logic at the B.A. level <a href=https://cccp.uni-koeln.de/sites/cccp/Lehre/2023_SS/23-03-09_Syllabus_Forschungslogik_Sommer23.pdf>[syllabus (german)]</a>. In the winter term 2023/24 I teach Women in European politics <a href=https://cccp.uni-koeln.de/sites/cccp/Lehre/2023-24_WS/23-07-11_Syllabus_FrauenEU_hheb.pdf>[syllabus (german)]</a> and Institutional Reform of the European Union <a href=https://cccp.uni-koeln.de/sites/cccp/Lehre/2023-24_WS/23-07-11_Syllabus_ReformEU_hheb.pdf>[syllabus (english)]</a>. I am also happy to supervise bachelor theses in the fields of women in politics, democratic representation, political communication, and other adjecent fields. If you are interested in being supervised by me, do reach out via my <a href="mailto:heberer@wiso.uni-koeln.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">university email</a>.
